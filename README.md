# MTER
['Explainable Recommendation via Multi-Task Learning in Opinionated Text Data'](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210010)

A parallel implementation of MTER with derived gradients based on the idea of parameter server. Directly run MTER_tripletensor_tucker.py in folder 'parallel_implementation' to test our MTER model by tunning hyper parameters. The learned models are stored in 'Results'. The processed Yelp dataset is included in yelp_restaurant_recursive_entry_sigir.
